# Helios Smart Environments

The goal of task 4.7 inside Helios project is to research the ad-hoc and organic creation of non-intrusive social networks without requiring user interventions. This task investigates the use of IoT devices and smart environments to ensure the ad-hoc networks are labelled correctly, aligned with the context in which they were created.

Researching and developing tasks have been focused in following keys:

-	Detection of proximity
-	Sensors technologies: Bluetooth and other sensors 
-	Smart environments
-	IoT devices
